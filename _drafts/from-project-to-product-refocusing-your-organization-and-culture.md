Today, Chris Jones, partner at Silicon Valley Product Group and co-author of the book Empowered joins us to talk about the shift to agility and a product-focused culture.

Chris shares how too many times, we focus on delivering a project that we assume has a beginning, middle, and end when we should look at it differently. Successful organizations treat such efforts as a product where there is not necessarily a planned end in mind. There are full-time product teams that are hyper-focused on delivering customer-focused solutions to problems.
