Before you adopt agile, you need to know where to start and then continuously measure its success. In today's spirited podcast, I speak with Jim Starrett, Head of Platform Engagement and Adoption at Bottomline Technologies. We talk about how he and his team transform Bottomline's teams to adopt agile techniques, build a roadmap to a successful design, and implement a consistent maturity model.
