I am willing to bet that the happiest teams feel they are working toward an objective that will delight their customers and move the needle on their product.

In today's podcast, I speak with Anthony Murphy, Director and founding member of the Association of Product Professionals. He shares how organizations and teams can define a winning product strategy. He also shares the differences between a vision, a strategy, and a roadmap.
