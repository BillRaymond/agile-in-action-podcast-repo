In this podcast, I speak with Bethann Zaveson, Director Portfolio Management, IT at AmTrust Financial. Bethann walks us through her career path from more formal frameworks like stage-gate and portfolio management.

Bethann provides valuable insights into how she is transitioning to agile and how it can positively impact the flow of your business.
