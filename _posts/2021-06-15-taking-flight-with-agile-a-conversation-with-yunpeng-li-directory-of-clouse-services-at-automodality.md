In the 1990s, organizations spent billions on large-scale, monolithic software solutions, such as ERP and MRP systems. Now, in the 2000s, innovative new technologies are changing the way we work.

In today's podcast, I speak with Yunpeng Li, Director of Cloud Services at AutoModality. Yunpeng shares the exciting advances AutoModality is making using drones to ensure our safety and how agile and cloud technology makes it possible.
